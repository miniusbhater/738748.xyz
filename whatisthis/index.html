    <h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>For some reason i bought this domain and have no idea what to do with it so i looked up the hex colour code that corresponded with the name of the site: 738748 and just set the background to that colour which happened to be a shade of green.</p>
<p>my main site can be found <a href="https://miniusbhater.uk">here</a></p>
